We introduce an interpretable machine learning framework that leverages temporal pupil dynamics to distinguish ADHD and control groups. By extracting novel dynamic dilation/constriction rate features and integrating behavioral metrics, our models achieve strong diagnostic accuracy while maintaining clinical interpretability.
